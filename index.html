            <h3>Granada: "Moorish Jewel"</h3>
            <p>
              Over the centuries, a veritable melting pot of cultures and
              civilizations have inhabited Andalucia. Granada is like a living
              museum paying homage to these legacies, making the city one of the
              most captivating destinations in Spain. Granada is also surrounded
              by some of the most dramatic natural scenery in the region, giving
              life to nature routes through ravines, waterfalls, and up to the
              highest peaks in mainland Spain.
              <br /><br />
              Granada is home to one of Spain's most visited tourist
              attractions, the Alhambra. The magnificent historical complex is
              made up of a majestic palace, a Moorish fortress, and exquisite
              gardens.

                In addition to our cozy space indoors, we have four tables out
                on the plaza with a view of the Alhambra. All of our pastries
                are home-baked. We also support the small businesses that are
                part of our community. Our bread is from the neighborhood and
                our organic whole wheat bread is from Quentar. Additionally, we
                offer a variety of craft jams from the Lecrín Valley and craft
                beers from different parts of the province.

                "Enjoyed looking at the Alhambra while sipping my tea and eating
                a brunch of toasted baguettes with fresh tomatoes and olive oil
                or fig jam and butter. Highly recommend! Especially if you are
                lucky enough to score an outdoor table under the awning." -

              Hi! My name is Tali and I spent a couple months studying in
              Granada until COVID forced my return to Vancouver, BC. I'm very
              fond of the city and since leaving, I've longed to return.
