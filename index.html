            <h3>Granada: "Moorish Jewel"</h3>
            <p>
              Over the centuries, a veritable melting pot of cultures and
              civilizations have inhabited Andalucia. Granada is like a living
              museum paying homage to these legacies, making the city one of the
              most captivating destinations in Spain. Granada is also surrounded
              by some of the most dramatic natural scenery in the region, giving
              life to nature routes through ravines, waterfalls, and up to the
              highest peaks in mainland Spain.
              <br /><br />
              Granada is home to one of Spain's most visited tourist
              attractions, the Alhambra. The magnificent historical complex is
              made up of a majestic palace, a Moorish fortress, and exquisite
              gardens.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Tali and I spent a couple months studying in
              Granada until COVID forced my return to Vancouver, BC. I'm very
              fond of the city and since leaving, I've longed to return.
